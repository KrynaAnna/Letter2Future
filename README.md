# Capsule
Capsule is a web app that allows anyone to write a letter to their future self.

# Description
The main work of the program is based on the Python web framework Flask.

Capsule is a web app that allows anyone to write a letter to their future self. 
This application functions with the help of the Pythonanywhere server, using the open source database - SQLite/MySQL. 
The design was created using HTML/CSS/JS, for developing responsive website used Bootstrap.
The preliminary template of the site was developed on the web platform - Ð¡anva. The graphic elements were drawn by me in the CorelDraw program.

# Logic
The main logic of the application is to send a letter to the future using the simplgmail library. The file main.py starts the server and works on the Flask framework. This allows you to see a web page, fill out a form and send it to the database on the server. The file checker.py is run on the pythonanywhere platform as a task that runs daily at 00:01, it checks the database for emails that are due to be sent today. If there are such letters, it starts the file mail.py. The file mail.py performs the process of sending a letter to the consumer, if the number of sent messages exceeds 100, the messages are deleted to the trash in order not to fill the memory of the mailbox.
